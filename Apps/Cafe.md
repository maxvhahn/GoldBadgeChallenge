To start running the application, be sure to set this project as the default start.
When running the app the user will be shown a menu that they may select 4 options.

The menu options will show up as seen here:

### Create New Item
When creating a new menu item, the user will be prompted to enter information.  After entering the correct information for each prompt, the user will need to depress the "Enter" key on the keyboard.

The user will be prompted with the following code first:

`Enter the meal number for the item:`

To satisfy this request, the user must type in a whole integer (i.e. 3, 12, 132). 

Next the user will see:
`Enter the name of the meal:`

The user will type in the name of their meal using letters.

Then the user will satisfy the next request:

`Enter a description of the meal:`

Here the user will type in how they would describe the meal.

Next the user will type the ingredients for this meal.

`Enter the ingredients in the meal:`

Once the user completes this, they will be asked to enter the price of the meal.  You do not need to include a dollar sign when completing this step.  However, you are welcome to include a decimal (i.e. 3.99, 6, or 6.00)

`Enter the price of the meal:`

Once the user is finished fulfilling each request, the user will tap "Enter" and then be asked to tap any key to return to the main menu.

To view the created item, the user may select "2" on the menu.

### View All Items

### Delete Existing Items

To delete an item, the user must type "3" and then tap on the "Enter" key on the keyboard.

The user will then be shown the list of all the current items.

Once the user sees which meal they would like to remove from this list, they may tap any key on the keyboard to continue.

Then the user will be prompted which meal they would like to remove from the list. Type the correct meal name in and the user will be told that their meal was successfully removed.

If the user mistyped the name of the meal, they will be told so and will begin the process over from the start menu.

### Exit
By selecting 4, you will exit this instance of the console.
